## Overview
The app allows you to create a library of your favorite songs and play them in the browser. Simply add a song by pasting in a youtube or SoundCloud URL.

## Features
- Add youtube or soundcloud song links
- Store songs in a library with others and share them
- Add songs to your own saved personal queue
- Play any song in the library or in your queue

## Technologies
- On the client side I used React to create my components and Material UI to style them with both custom and default styles. To make GraphQL operations from the client I used the Apollo Client library.
- I used GraphQL to set up endpoints for querying and posting data into my server on Hasura. The GraphQL server is connected to a PostgreSQL database that stores all of the individual songs in the library.
